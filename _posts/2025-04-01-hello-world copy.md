So i've written a small C-Program that goes by the name of calc.

You can find it, like my other stuff, in my github repo.

https://github.com/c0zy1/pwn-scripts/tree/main/pwn-scripts/c-projects/calculator/challenge-calc

There you will find calc(compiled binary) and calc.c (C-Sourcecode) and the flag.

If you do the challenge and find any bugs, or have questions, issues or want to give feedback, be sure to comment down below!

Best of Luck.
