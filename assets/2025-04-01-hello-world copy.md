Introduction

In the first part of this series, we explored how to set up the router and gather initial reconnaissance data.
In this phase, we will take that reconnaissance further with a more detailed analysis of the exposed attack vectors, and assess whether existing PoCs, Exploit-DB snippets, or other public resources can be adapted to our target.
