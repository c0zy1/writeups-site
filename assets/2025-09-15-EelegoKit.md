A few weeks ago i bought the eelego beginners kit and have so far done almost all exercises. 

In this post i'll just show you some of the pictures i took while putting together the boards and give you a short review on why it is definitely worth it to invest those 37â‚¬ and some time to get a feeling for hardware, pins etc.

Here are 3 exemplary exercises and what small learning i gained on each exercise.
